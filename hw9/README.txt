1. My Program Compiles

2. Program runs to completion

3. Everything works as far as my testing goes. My output for g1 matches with the expected output given on the website completely (except that I added several more features to make the outputs a little more orgranized).

4. I ran testGraphs() on all 23 graphs and didn't receive any error. 

5. I first tried to implement printDijkstraPaths recursively and it did work. However, gettig the recursive method to print the extra information other than the path was a pain, so I change to an iterative approach instead.
