1. My Program Compiles
2. Program runs to completion
3. Everything works as far as my testing goes. I did many testings beside the screenshots. I didn't include them in the submission because that would be too many images. The remove method seems to work. However, more tests can be conducted because there can never be enough testing.
4. I tried to fix my BTree.java and BTreeNode.java based on your comments from the previous submission, and somehow I got a NullPointerException. So I undid most changes. I didn't have time to check why the error occured. I'll do that over the weekend.
